## Exercise

In this exercise you will use QGIS to create a map showing the change in housing units in New 
York City neighborhoods since 2010. 

The housing data is available publically from the NYC Data Clearinghouse [NYCOpenData ](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us)

![NYCopendata]

Specifically, this data is provided by the NYC Department of City Planning from their housing 
database. You can access the data at the census tract level from [this link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Database-by-2020-Census-Tract/nahe-je7c)
